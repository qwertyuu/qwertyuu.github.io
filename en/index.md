  excerpt: |-
    This **Unity 3D** game was created in 4 hours. A friend and I made it during a games competition on itch.io! The goal of the game is simple, to save ourselves from Gilles the monster.

    Frameskip was named [Most innovative game concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20190502071114/https://itch.io/jam/icantdraw/results/most-innovative-game-concept) during the competition.

  excerpt: PCB is a "clicker" type game that consists of collecting more and more
    money by buying parts for your printed circuit board. It also has the particularity
    of being able to create music with certain kinds of components, inspired by [Pocket
    Operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8DYAChg9AM) controllers. The project
    was made in Unity 3D

  title: Epitacle
  excerpt: This simulation game is actually a cellular automaton that is very mesmerizing.
    Created in one evening with the same friend as for Frameskip! Also, the cellular
    automaton is run in a shader, which, I think, is kind of a big achievement in
    itself. The rules for the automaton are encoded on a texture file for the shader.

    As part of a GameJam (video game creation in 48 hours) at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi in October 2018, I had the chance to work on developing a VR game with some members of [Totema Studio](https://totemastudio.com/).

    The game runs on Oculus Rift VR helmets and uses the Oculus SDK in Unity 3D. I made the entirety of the VR adaptation and VR game controls
