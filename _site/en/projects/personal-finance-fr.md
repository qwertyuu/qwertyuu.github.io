This page presents a French translation I created and host of the "Personal Income Spending Flowchart - Canada".

I translated this guide with the intention of sharing this knowledge that was very useful to me when I was looking for ways to manage my money well. I'm lucky, I know English, but not all my close ones have this chance. So I took the time, using claude.ai and an OCR tool (automated character detection) to translate and redo all the content in French using Quebec terms.

The original was created in 2016 by Reddit user 'atlasvoid' ({{link("original diagram in English", "https://i.imgur.com/zlGnuDO.png")}} | {{link("Reddit post", "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/55o0tr/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/")}}}). The infographic was made by me on {{link("tldraw.com", "https://www.tldraw.com/")}}.

I also created {{link("a Reddit post on /r/QuebecFinance", "https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/comments/1hf9nxp/lorganigramme_de_personalfinancecanada_maintenant/")}} where several people said they found the translation of this content useful and shared it with their close ones in turn. The community moderator even wants to include it in their community guide! The post accumulated 16,000+ views in the first 48 hours.
