BorIA is a group of artificial intelligence enthusiasts created and organized by {{link("Raphaël Côté", "/contact" | locale_url)}}, {{link("Michelle Fournier", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-fournier-02364133/")}} and {{link("Dominic Tremblay-Gagnon", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-tremblay-gagnon/")}}.

The objective is to bring together students, researchers, workers, and enthusiasts from the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean region so they can exchange and learn together.

The format is as follows: We gather in a room and present several 15-minute presentations (or "talks") that are recorded, encouraging audience questions after each one. Afterwards, the presentations are shared on the YouTube channel.
