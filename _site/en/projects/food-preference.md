## Origin
The idea for this project was born from a specific need of my vegan friends' couple. When I visited them, I often had trouble finding suitable snacks without having to read the entire list of ingredients on each product at the grocery store.

## Developed Solution
To address this need, I used the ingredient list available on the Metro website and created a lightweight and accessible directory. This directory allows easy consultation of the list of products with entirely vegan ingredients. I also used artificial intelligence to automatically generate the page code, almost from start to finish. This demonstrates that "fully integrated" artificial intelligence tools are emerging. I shared my opinion on this matter on {{ link("Lagrange on LinkedIn", "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269526884969758722/") }} after completing this project.

## Concept Extension
The concept was expanded to include other specific needs, notably for a friend's mother who was looking for products without allergens. For example, I created a section dedicated to gluten-free products, useful for people suffering from celiac disease (gluten intolerance): {{ link("Metro products for gluten intolerance", "https://static.raphaelcote.com/MetroSansGluten/") }}.
